One of Boris Johnson's main policy aims is to tackle regional inequality in Britain. Discussions of regional inequality often look at the bottom of the ladder, focusing on places where there is little opportunity. It's important to look at the top as well and understand the places where people have access to power.

Exploring where our elite live is important to solving regional inequality. The wider the distribution of British elite, the wider the set of perspectives of those in power. If there had been more Northern Irelanders in Boris Johnson's life, would he have compared the borders of [Camden & Islington to Ireland & Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-43210156)? Would Karen Bradley have [failed to understand](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/07/karen-bradley-admits-not-understanding-northern-irish-politics) the sectarian split between Northern Irish parties? More seriously, would we see the current indifference to [violence in Northern Ireland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-56664868) by the government?

### Where do they come from?

Understanding where Britain's elite grow up means understanding elite education. Education and eliteness are deeply linked in British culture, the first image that springs to mind when discussing the elite is often a group of Etonians leaning over with wry smirks. While educational disparities have not received the same [bravado as infrastructure](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/build-build-build-prime-minister-announces-new-deal-for-britain), they are key to solving regional inequality. Former Secretary of State for Education [Justine Greening agrees on this](https://www.ft.com/content/b4a9cac9-0c19-48cd-a6d5-1526fbae7418).

[Data on school performance in England](https://www.compare-school-performance.service.gov.uk/schools-by-type?step=phase&geographic=all&region=0&phase=secondary&for=16to18) shows a strong concentration of elite schools in the South. 18 of the top 50 are found in London with more in nearby towns such as Barnet and Saint Albans. This concentration of top performing schools has two negative effects on regional inequality. The first is that the current generation of elites must live nearby to give their children the best opportunities. The second that the next generation of elites will have grown up in the same area too. These two effects mean concentrated elite schooling helps cause a concentrated elite.

The [expected decrease in social mobility due to COVID](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/01/disadvantaged-and-bame-pupils-lost-more-learning-study-finds) means that this problem is likely to be exacerbated without government intervention.

### Where do they go?

The bias towards the South of England extends into later life too. In 2011 the [Great British Class Survey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_British_Class_Survey) collected information on people's income, assets, social status, and cultural views to try and build a class map of Britain. This survey was useful as it attempted to look at class from more than just a financial perspective.

[Analysis of the survey](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0038038513481128) found that elites often attended universities in the South of England, particularly in London, Oxford, Cambridge, and Bristol. After university it found that the UK's elite was highly concentrated in the South of England, particularly in London and the immediate surrounding area.

If the government is to reap the [political gains](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/social-mobility-barometer-2021) of solving regional inequality it not only needs to give opportunity to those that have little, it also needs to give people from all regions access to power. This means dealing with the concentration of elites in the South.
