I am shit at writing. I partly blame this on the UK's education system; early specialisation in STEM means I haven't written for credit since I was 16. I wrote some essays for extra-curricular activities at university but these were all terminally cringe (both in content and in writing ability). I also blame my laziness. I've never critically looked at the style of anything I've written down and I've never sought external advice. Finally there's the problem of ego. It's never nice to examine the precise details of why you're shit at something. To remedy problems 2 & 3 I'm trying to write more and write better.

Why share this then? Because there are likely other STEM folk who see themselves in my first paragraph. I hope my notes can be useful to them.

For starters I read Strunk & White's [Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style), Orwell's [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/), and a bunch of random Hemingway quotes about writing. Below are my abridged notes. These three works prioritise clear & concise communication above all else[\*](#abcde).

It's worth noting that they introduce only **one** style of writing. Nothing in these notes should be considered gospel; you can and should break all of these rules. You can safely ignore Orwell's claims that disregarding these rules makes you a bad writer. Instead they are useful for bad writers (like myself) to become okay writers with a palatable style.

Hope these notes help!

### Approach

- Be concise.
- Revise, revise, revise.
- Watch out for pretentiousness.
- Give opinions sparingly.
- Show don't tell.

### Style

- Use the active voice:
  - The pen was bounced across the floor by me.
  - I bounced the pen across the floor.
- Use positive statements:
  - The water was not very calm that day.
  - The water was wild that day.
- Use definite, specific, concrete ideas:
  - This began a period of prolific output.
  - He wrote 23 books in 10 years.
- Avoid qualifiers, especially overstating:
  - Absolutely anyone could see how vitally important that day was.
  - Anyone could see how important that day was.
- Think about nouns & verbs more than adjectives & adverbs.
- Only use abbreviations and acronyms when certain they'll be understood.
- Each paragraph should be a distinct unit of information.

### Sentence Structure

- Keep related words together:
  - The sun cast a beam on the wall that was bright yellow.
  - The sun cast a bright yellow beam on the wall.
- Keep the verb and the subject together, unless if you wish to build suspense:
  - The jelly, when hit, creates a foul sound.
  - When hit, the jelly creates a foul sound.
- Modifiers should be placed next to what they modify:
  - She only struck two of them.
  - She struck only two of them.
- The end of a sentence has emphasis:
  - She was his brother, so said the DNA test.
  - The DNA test was in, she was his brother.
- The start of a sentence has emphasis, unless if it's the subject:
  - His favourite thing in life was wealth.
  - Wealth was his favourite thing in life.
- Use parallel structure to highlight similarity & difference:
  - It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times.

### Punctuation

- Commas are for linked independent clauses:
  - It was raining, and the time was half three.
- Commas are also for parenthetic clauses:
  - It was raining, here at least, and the time was half three.
- Semicolons are for independent clauses:
  - It was raining; the time was half three.
- Full stops are for independent clauses with an emphasis:
  - It was raining. The time was half three.
- Dashes are for casual asides:
  - It was raining - harder than before. The time was half three.
- Colons should not break the flow of a sentence:
  - For banjo playing you need: a hand, another hand, and a banjo.
  - For banjo playing you need three things: a hand, another hand, and a banjo.
- Exclamation marks are only for exclamations:
  - It was a fine sunset!
  - Such a fine sunset!
- Numerals should be used over words:
  - The robbery took place on the ninth of October.
  - The robbery took place on October 9th.
