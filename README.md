This repo is for my personal website. There are two important branches: `main` which contains the code I work on, and `deploy` which contains the current build. There is a Github Action which auto-deploys every time an update is pushed to `main`.

# Tech

The website is hosted on Github Pages. The frontend is made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a framework for static websites built on [React](https://reactjs.org/). The styling mostly comes from [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).
